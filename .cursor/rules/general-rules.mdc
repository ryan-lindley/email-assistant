# General Rules for the Email Management Agent
Applies to: **/*.py

- Use Python 3.11+ syntax and features.
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines (e.g., 4-space indentation, snake_case for variables).
- Include type hints for all function parameters and return types.
- Write concise docstrings for every function and class in Google style format.
- Handle exceptions explicitly with try-except blocks and log errors using the `logging` module.
- Prefer modular code: break functionality into small, reusable functions or classes.
- Use environment variables (via `python-dotenv`) for sensitive data like API keys or credentials.
