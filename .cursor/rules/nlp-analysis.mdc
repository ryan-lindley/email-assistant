# NLP Analysis Rules
Applies to: **/nlp_*.py, **/analysis_*.py

- Use `spacy` or `transformers` (e.g., a lightweight BERT model) for natural language processing to detect email importance.
- Train or fine-tune a model to classify emails as "important" based on user-provided examples (e.g., "meeting with boss" vs. "newsletter").
- Extract a brief summary (1-2 sentences) of important emails using text summarization techniques.
- Avoid heavy NLP models unless explicitly requested; prioritize speed for real-time processing.
- Cache NLP results in the database to reduce redundant processing.
